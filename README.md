# Water-Level-Monitoring-System
An IoT-based water level monitoring system is an advanced, automated, and highly scalable solution that monitors the volume of water filled in tanks in real-time. And since it is an automated system, it will also save human energy and time.

In this smart system, the water tank consists of sensors that detect the water level. Further, a microcontroller reads this sensor data and sends the information to the cloud thus allowing it to operate the system from anywhere.

Also, the water level control system is a full-fledged solution with flexible features that can be customized for all use cases.
